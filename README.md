# Master in Bioinformatics and Functional genomics
Some exercises and example for the neural networks section of the course.

## Setup
To setup everything needed for the lessons, once you have python and git installed on your system, please run the following script in your terminal:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics.git
  cd Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Lessons
### 1 - 7/05/2019 - Lesson on MLP
#### Summary
In [this lesson](), we will learn how to use a multi-layer perceptron to predict the values of an arbitraty *unknown* function.

### 2 - 13/05/2019 - Practice on MLP
#### Summary
In this lesson, after learning how to load and execute a preliminary analysis on a real dataset, we will create an MLP model and introduce the concept of Dropout layers. Guided free experimentation will follow.

### 3 - 14/05/2019 - Lesson on CNN
#### Summary
In this lesson we will learn how to create a convolutional neural network that can learn patterns.

### 4 - 20/05/2019 - Practice on CNN
#### Summary
Work in progress...

### 5 - 21/05/2019 - Lesson on prediction active regulatory regions
#### Summary
Work in progress...

### 6 - 27/05/2019 - Practice on active regulatory regions
#### Summary
Work in progress...

## Additional materials
In this brief course we could not touch as deeply as we would like to a number of topics, so here are a few links that any of you could explore. I tried to select only materials that I enjoyed and that I would love to watch again.
