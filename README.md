# Master in Bioinformatics and Functional genomics
Some exercises and example for the neural networks section of the course.

## Setup
To setup everything needed for the lessons, once you have python and git installed on your system, please run the following script in your terminal:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics.git
  cd Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Lessons
### 1 - 6/05/2019 - Lesson on MLP
#### Summary
In this lesson, we will learn how to use a multi-layer perceptron to predict the values of an arbitraty *unknown* function.

### 2 - 7/05/2019 - Practice on MLP
#### Summary
In this lesson, we will resolve three exercises:
- We will create a simple MLP model
- We will try different optimizers
- We will try to predict different black box functions

### 3 - 13/05/2019 - Lesson on CNN
#### Summary
In this lesson we will learn how to create a convolutional neural network that can learn patterns.

### 4 - 14/05/2019 - Practice on CNN
#### Summary
