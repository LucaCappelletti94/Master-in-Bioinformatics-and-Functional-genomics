# Master in Bioinformatics and Functional genomics
Some exercises and example for the neural networks section of the course.

## Setup
To setup everything needed for the lessons, once you have python and git installed on your system, please run the following script in your terminal:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics.git
  cd Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics
  python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Lessons
### [1 - Lesson on MLP](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics/tree/master/1%20-%20Lesson%20on%20MLP)

In [this lesson](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics/tree/master/1%20-%20Lesson%20on%20MLP), we will learn how to use a multi-layer perceptron to predict the values of an arbitraty *unknown* function.

### [2 - Practice on MLP](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics/tree/master/2%20-%20Practice%20on%20MLP)

In [this lesson](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics/tree/master/2%20-%20Practice%20on%20MLP), after learning how to load and execute a preliminary analysis on a real dataset, we will create an MLP model and introduce the concept of Dropout layers. Guided free experimentation will follow.

### [3 - Lesson and practice on CNN](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics/tree/master/3%20-%20Lesson%20on%20CNN)

In [this lesson](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics/tree/master/3%20-%20Lesson%20on%20CNN) we will learn how to create a convolutional neural network that can learn patterns, afterwards we will proceed to create a neural network that repairs a pattern.

### [4 - Lesson on prediction active regulatory regions](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics/tree/master/4%20-%20Lesson%20on%20prediction%20active%20regulatory%20regions)
In [this lesson](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/Master-in-Bioinformatics-and-Functional-genomics/tree/master/4%20-%20Lesson%20on%20prediction%20active%20regulatory%20regions) we have practiced with the preparation of the active regulatory regions dataset (retrieving data, one-hot encoding data, quick dataset analysis, preparation of the labels for training) and used the data for training a simple MLP.

### 5 - 27/05/2019 - Creating, testing and deploying a neural network

In this lesson, in a step by step fashion, we created a MLP trained on the standard dataset Boston Housing and proceeded with guided experimentation in class with its model structure. Afterwards, a simple pytest test was created to test the model in a CI fashion.
Finally, a simple example of the neural network deployment for production was shown.

## Additional materials
In this brief course we could not touch as deeply as we would like to a number of topics, so here are a few links that any of you could explore. I tried to select only materials that I enjoyed and that I would love to watch again.
